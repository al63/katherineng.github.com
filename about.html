				<p> Now this is the story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down, and I'd like to take a minute just sit right there. I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air. In west Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground where I spent most of my days, chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool, and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school, when a couple of guys, they were up to no good started making trouble in my neighbourhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, and said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air." <br><br>

				I begged and pleaded with her day after day, but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way. She gave me a kiss, and then she gave me my ticket. I put my walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it." First class, yo this is bad. Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmmmmm this might be alright. But wait I hear there're prissy, bourgeois, and all that. Is Bel-Air the type of place they send this cool cat? I don't think so. I'll see when I get there. I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air. <br><br>

				Well, the plane landed and when I came out, there was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out. I ain't trying to get arrested. I just got here. I sprang with the quickness like lightening, disappeared. I whistled for a cab, and when it came near the license plate said "fresh" and had a dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, "Nah, forget it, yo homes to Bel-Air!" I pulled up to a house about seven or eight, and I yelled to the cabby "Yo, homes smell you later!" Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air.</p>
